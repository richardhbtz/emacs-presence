[[./images/presence-preview.png]]

** Installation

*** Manual Installation

Place `presence.el` in an Emacs-findable directory. On Windows, ensure `stdpipe.ps1` is in the same directory.

** Quick Start

Enable "presence-mode" by adding this to your Emacs configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'presence)
(presence-mode)
#+END_SRC

Customize settings using:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
M-x customize-group RET presence RET
#+END_SRC

** Icon Customization

Personalize icons for activities and modes. Icons are tied to your Discord application ID in `presence-client-id`. To suggest new icons, open an [[./issues][issue]].

*** Create Your Own Discord Application

Craft a custom 'Application':

1. Visit [[https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/][Discord's application page]].

2. Upload icons as "small" assets.

Configure `presence-client-id` with your new application's ID and set `presence-mode-icon-alist` to use your icons.
